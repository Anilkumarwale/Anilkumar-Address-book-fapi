At the time of writing this, the API has three models which would be Task, User and Address. Task model is totally unrestricted, anyone can perform CRUD operations on it. User module is for authentication which is token based. Authenticated users can add address and perform CRUD on it. Object level filtering has been applied which would restrict users to perform CRUD operations on addresses which were not created by them.
